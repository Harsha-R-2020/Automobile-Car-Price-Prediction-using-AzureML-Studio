# Automobile-Car-Price-Prediction-using-AzureML-Studio
 Using Azure Machine Learning studio, To create a Linear Regressor model to predict the price of an automobile with its features (like horsepower,peakrpm,engine-type,body-style etc...).

Problem Statement:
The project is to predict the Automobile Price based on the features of an automobile (horsepower,peakrpm,engine-type,body-style etc...).

Using Azure Machine Learning studio, To create a Linear Regressor model to predict the price of an automobile with its features (like horsepower,peakrpm,engine-type,body-style etc...).

The main objective behind the project is to predict the price of an automobile with its features (like horsepower,peakrpm,engine-type,body-style etc...)..For this implementation first we need to get the data in .csv format. We can use the sample data set [Automobile price data _Raw_.csv] provided in the platform itself. The raw data is completely spread in our blank canvas. The attributes includes make, body-style, wheel-base, engine-size, horsepower, peak-rpm and highway-mpg. Preprocessing of data is done before training and analyzing the model. The data must be clean so that the model can predict correctly. For this purpose the empty[Null] values are removed by using column dataset model. Then split the data and then pass the results to the Two Class Boosted decisions algorithm module to train the model. Finally evaluate them. Now the data is ready, constructing a predictive model consists of training and testing. We'll use our own or sample data to train the model, and then we'll test the model to see how accurately it is able to predict price of the automobile.
